    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Rice is a staple crop central to food security and national economies, including Colombia’s. Monitoring its spatial–temporal dynamics—particularly phenological stages—enables early production estimates and informs research, environmental assessments, and competitiveness analyses [[3](#ref-dong_xiao_rev); [2](#ref-dong2016)]. Timely crop information also supports decisions on imports, price regulation, and sectoral policies, while phenology underpins agronomic management, crop identification, yield estimation, and input optimization [[13](#ref-zheng2016131); [11](#ref-waldini2021)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining accurate, timely information on cultivated area and phenological stages remains challenging because field surveys are costly and time‑consuming [[20](#ref-mosleh2015application)]. In Colombia, heterogeneity further complicates monitoring: irrigated and rainfed systems coexist; field sizes range from <10 to >200 ha; and land preparation spans from leveled paddies to sloped plots [[1](#ref-censo_general)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative. Time‑series imagery supports large‑area monitoring and phenology mapping more efficiently than ground surveys [[11](#ref-waldini2021)]. Optical indices such as NDVI are widely used [[21](#ref-palakuru2021exploring)], but in Colombia’s rainfed systems persistent cloud cover during the crop season limits optical observations. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) overcomes cloud and illumination constraints [[12](#ref-yang2021112394)]. This work exploits dual‑polarization Sentinel‑1 data via the Dual‑polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI) to track rice phenology; detailed polarimetric rationale and processing appear in the dedicated DpRVI section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index (DpRVI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dual-polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI) is an innovative vegetation index designed for monitoring crop growth using dual-polarization SAR data, such as that provided by the Sentinel-1 mission [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual)]. It was developed to robustly and sensitively characterize vegetation dynamics, outperforming traditional backscatter-based approaches. Unlike other indices, DpRVI is normalized between 0 and 1, making it easier to interpret, particularly for users without radar expertise [[18](#ref-mandal2021radar)].\n",
    "\n",
    "The DpRVI's effectiveness stems from its fundamental design as a composite metric that captures both polarimetric complexity (degree of polarization, m) and scattering mechanism dominance (β = λ₁/Span) [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual)]. Unlike conventional backscatter ratios (σ°VH/σ°VV) or simple polarimetric parameters, DpRVI encodes the complete second-order statistical characterization of the scattering process through the covariance matrix eigenvalue decomposition [[18](#ref-mandal2021radar)].\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in [Figure 1](#fig-DpRVI), the preprocessing workflow for Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) data follows the approach in [[16](#ref-mandal2019sentinel)]. Images were initially split into three subswaths to facilitate processing. Precise orbit files were then applied, followed by radiometric calibration, keeping outputs in complex format as required to form polarimetric matrices [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual)]. The DpRVI index was generated using the SNAP software (version 11.0) from the European Space Agency (ESA), which provides advanced support for polarimetric processing and dual-polarization index computation from Sentinel-1 SLC data."

This second-order characterization is what enables DpRVI to respond consistently to structural changes in the canopy.\n",
    "\n",

    "ENL (equivalent number of looks) quantifies speckle reduction achieved by spatial averaging; in homogeneous areas it can be estimated as the squared mean‑to‑standard‑deviation ratio of intensity, with larger ENL indicating lower speckle and more stable covariance estimates. Window size therefore controls the trade‑off between speckle suppression and spatial detail. Following [[16](#ref-mandal2019sentinel)], a $5\\times5$ refined Lee filter yields sufficient ENL to robustly estimate $C_{11}$, $C_{22}$, $\\Re(C_{12})$, and $\\Im(C_{12})$ while preserving field boundaries. In mosaics with smaller, heterogeneous rice parcels, a $3\\times3$ window may better preserve edges, whereas $7\\times7$ increases smoothing; here a $5\\times5$ window is adopted as a balanced choice for Casanare.\n",

    "DpRVI exhibits a clear monotonic increase during vegetative development and aligns with annotated phenological transitions in cereal crops [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual)]. Compared with simple backscatter ratios ($\\sigma^\\circ_{VH}/\\sigma^\\circ_{VV}$) and Radar Vegetation Index (RVI), DpRVI provides a more stable and interpretable temporal trajectory from dual-pol data [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual)]. Reported correlations with canopy descriptors such as Plant Area Index (PAI), vegetation water content (VWC), and dry biomass support its sensitivity to structural changes [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual); [18](#ref-mandal2021radar)]. Finally, terrain correction was applied using UTM Zone 18N. All outputs were standardized to 14×14 m resolution and clipped to each study area.

    "### DpRVI across rice stages\n",
    "\n",
    "By analogy with cereals reported in [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual)], DpRVI is expected to rise from land preparation and early leaf development (low structural complexity) through tillering and stem elongation, reflecting increasing canopy volume scattering. Around booting to heading, DpRVI typically remains high as the canopy reaches maximum structural complexity, while late‑season senescence may slightly reduce polarization purity and alter scattering balance. This qualitative behavior guides stage interpretation but should be validated with local field observations.\n",

    "For this work, Sentinel-1 SLC images covering the municipality of Nunchía (Casanare, Colombia)—where rainfed rice is predominant—were used (see [Figure 2](#fig-dprvi-cube)). The Dual‑polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI) was computed from these images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with sits, analyses rely on regular Earth observation data cubes that ensure consistent dimensionality for machine learning: seamless spatial coverage, regular temporal cadence, and no gaps. When ARD collections are irregular in time or space, they must be converted to regular cubes prior to classification; national implementations such as Brazil Data Cube provide regular cubes by default [[10](#ref-simoes2021); [4](#ref-ferreira2020); [15](#ref-data4030092); [7](#ref-sitsbook)]. Unlike single‑tile cube definitions, sits supports cubes spanning multiple tiles, removing tiling restrictions during analysis [[15](#ref-data4030092); [7](#ref-sitsbook)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Although DpRVI is derived from Sentinel‑1 SLC data via the $\\mathbf{C2}$ workflow described above [[16](#ref-mandal2019sentinel); [17](#ref-mandal2020dual)], in practice precomputed DpRVI rasters are loaded into a `sits` cube for analysis. This separation keeps heavy polarimetric processing in SNAP and downstream time‑series analytics in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "A local data cube was created using the `sits` package in R [[10](#ref-simoes2021)] to enable time-series analysis and support crop monitoring and classification workflows. The `sits` package follows a time-first, space-later paradigm: it classifies per-pixel time series to produce probability cubes, and then applies spatial smoothing to improve map consistency. It also provides tools for training-sample quality control and class noise reduction [[9](#ref-santos2021a)], and interoperates with on-demand EO data cube processing backends such as gdalcubes [[15](#ref-data4030092)] and national implementations [[4](#ref-ferreira2020)].

    "[Figure 4](#fig-dprvi-multitemporal) presents temporal DpRVI signatures revealing three biophysically distinct behavioral categories essential for automated discrimination. Perennial vegetation covers exhibit stable, high-value profiles: forest maintains consistent values (~0.60 ± 0.02) with minimal seasonal variation, reflecting persistent volume scattering from mature canopy structure where randomly distributed scattering elements generate high depolarization. The slight decline toward July (~0.49) indicates seasonal changes in foliar moisture content, affecting dielectric properties and consequently the degree of polarization of radar waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, grasslands show slightly higher values (~0.63 ± 0.03) with gradual increase through the observation period. This behavior results from a less complex canopy structure but with sufficient aerial biomass to generate significant depolarization. The temporal increase observed reflects vegetative growth during the rainy season, increasing the anisotropy of the scattering medium and enhancing volume scattering contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenological interpretation uses the fact that rice stages exhibit characteristic dynamic patterns aligned with crop development cycles. All stages initiate with elevated DpRVI values (~0.50–0.60) before March, attributed to pre-existing vegetation or crop residues, followed by sharp declines to minimum values (~0.30–0.40) between April and May, corresponding to soil preparation and early sowing phases when surface scattering dominates over bare soils. The high degree of polarization during this phase reflects the absence of depolarizing elements. Subsequent DpRVI recovery (May–July) documents the transition toward volume scattering as rice canopy architecture develops, with each phenological stage showing distinct recovery trajectories that enable machine learning discrimination.\n",
    "\n",

    "To evaluate the quality of the training samples and detect possible labeling errors in the time series, a methodology combining Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and Bayesian Inference was applied. SOM is an unsupervised neural network technique that groups time series of satellite images according to their similarity, projecting high dimensional multitemporal data onto a two dimensional grid, where each neuron represents a cluster of similar temporal profiles and preserves topological relationships between inputs [[9](#ref-santos2021a)].\n",

    "Each training sample is assigned to a specific neuron based on its temporal similarity; consistent samples from the same class tend to cluster in neighboring regions of the SOM grid, while noisy samples often appear isolated or in unexpected areas, facilitating the visual detection of anomalies. After constructing the SOM, Bayesian Inference is used within and between clusters to assess the consistency and coherence of the samples, quantifying intra and inter cluster similarity, which allows for the identification of outliers or misclassified samples [[9](#ref-santos2021a)]. This combined approach is efficient and interpretable for validating the quality of the training data and helps reduce the risk of classification errors in subsequent modeling stages."

The perfect separation between forest–grass and rice stages validates that DpRVI effectively discriminates between stable volume-scattering patterns (permanent covers) and dynamic agricultural signatures.\n",

In all classes, the 75th percentile values are low (≈ 0.46–0.71), indicating that most of the territory consists of compact and homogeneous patches where a single class clearly dominates. Toward the 90–95 percentiles, variances increase, signaling mixed neighborhoods and boundaries between classes.\n",

In contrast, stem elongation is the most homogeneous, with P75 = 0.46, P90 ≈ 0.92 and P95 ≈ 1.86, suggesting compact patches and less confusion with adjacent classes.

The selection of a robust quantile (P90–P95) as reference is methodologically appropriate, considering that classes with greater spatial variability, such as leaf development and tillering, require higher hyperparameters (≈ 2–3) to preserve their intrinsic heterogeneity without incurring over-smoothing that eliminates valid spatial patterns.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The high classification performance supports DpRVI as a strong alternative to conventional radar vegetation indices for tropical crop monitoring, demonstrating robustness under conditions of high atmospheric moisture, variable precipitation, and diverse soil conditions. The DpRVI index integrates polarization purity (m) and scattering dominance (β = λ₁/Span) from the dual‑pol covariance, providing sensitivity to structural change beyond simple backscatter ratios [[17](#ref-mandal2020dual); [18](#ref-mandal2021radar)].\n",
    "\n",
    "During rice phenological development, the progressive transition from surface-dominated scattering (bare soil post-preparation) to volume-dominated mechanisms (developed canopy) manifests as systematic changes in both m and β parameters. The April DpRVI minima (~0.30) observed across all phenological stages correspond to peak soil contribution periods when polarimetric coherence remains high due to limited vegetation interference. The subsequent recovery reflects increasing canopy structural complexity, which enhances depolarization mechanisms and yields higher DpRVI values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This physical interpretation aligns with theoretical polarimetric scattering models and explains the observed classification success, particularly the effective discrimination between temporally proximate phenological stages (e.g., germination vs. leaf development).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification successfully captures the characteristic land use mosaic of the Casanare region:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forest distribution: Spatial continuity validates the model's ability to distinguish mature vegetation structure from agricultural systems through consistent volume-scattering signatures and stable DpRVI patterns (~0.6) throughout the observation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pastoral systems: Grasslands occupy transitional zones between forest and agricultural sectors, representing established cattle ranching systems typical of Colombian Llanos. These areas exhibit moderate DpRVI variability, reflecting less dense vegetation structure than forests but with sufficient biomass to generate detectable depolarization by radar sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agricultural concentration: Rice cultivation concentrates in the southeastern sector where topographic conditions (slopes <3%) create optimal conditions for rainfed rice production. This spatial concentration aligns with known agricultural zoning in the region, providing external validation of classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within agricultural areas, the classification reveals heterogeneous spatial distribution of phenological stages without dominant clustering of any single phase. This pattern reflects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Management unit coherence: Despite overall heterogeneity, individual agricultural parcels show internal phenological consistency, indicating synchronized management within farms while maintaining diversity across the landscape. This spatial coherence reflects uniform agricultural practices in soil preparation and early-stage management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multitemporal SAR with a 12‑day Sentinel‑1 revisit provides all‑weather, sufficiently frequent observations to capture phenological transitions; polarimetric sensitivity enables discrimination between adjacent crop stages. Stage discrimination at landscape scale (>10,000 ha) demonstrates the scalability of DpRVI‑based monitoring for agricultural surveillance. Increasing canopy complexity elevates depolarization, enabling detection of subtle developmental changes. The observed spatial coherence supports operational use for crop area estimation and early warning where optical systems suffer persistent cloud cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These results have significant implications for operational crop monitoring and agricultural management in Colombia:\n",
    "\n",
    "- National-scale implementation: The methodology can be scaled to support national assessments of sown area, early warning systems, and other agricultural applications where consistent, weather-independent monitoring is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision support: Although this work focused on a specific portion of the rice cultivation cycle and a particular region, it successfully identified six land cover classes including four distinct rice phenological stages, enabling farmers and policy makers to make informed and anticipatory decisions about resource management and allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The incorporation of supplementary polarimetric variables, such as temporal coherence and multitemporal backscatter from SAR data, could further improve classification accuracy, particularly in areas with complex phenological transitions or mixed pixel environments. The implementation of this SAR-based monitoring approach represents a significant advancement in Colombian agricultural monitoring, offering comprehensive early-season assessments across large areas with consistent quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work demonstrates the effective use of multitemporal DpRVI from Sentinel‑1 to monitor rice phenology in Colombian rainfed systems, with high accuracy across six classes (four phenological stages plus permanent covers). Our key findings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Polarimetric discrimination: DpRVI captures biophysical changes in canopy architecture, enabling separation of adjacent phenological stages.\n",
    "2. Operational viability: Freely available Sentinel‑1 data and open‑source tooling (sits in R) support cost‑effective implementation.\n",
    "3. Temporal specificity: Variable importance aligns with agriculturally meaningful periods, reinforcing the physical basis of discrimination.\n",
    "4. Spatial scalability: Landscape‑scale classification (>10,000 ha) with coherent maps supports national surveillance potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework advances SAR‑based agricultural monitoring and strengthens rice mapping where cloud cover limits optical data, providing a robust foundation for operational crop monitoring in tropical regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best‑practice validation avoids spatial leakage by splitting train/test at the parcel level and reports OA, κ, and class‑wise Precision/Recall/F1 from the confusion matrix; map‑level accuracy assessment complements cross‑validation where applicable [[10](#ref-simoes2021); [8](#ref-sokolova2009427); [7](#ref-sitsbook)].\n",
